Overview
========

The OpenDXL Nmap Python service exposes access to the `Nmap Security Scanner <https://nmap.org/docs.html>`_
via the `Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_ (DXL) fabric.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to access the Nmap tool utility for network discovery and
security auditing without having to focus on lower-level details such as Nmap-specific DXL topics and
message formats.
